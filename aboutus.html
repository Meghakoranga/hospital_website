    <p>
     We open the doors to India's
      largest private hospitalâ€”an institution that will be an icon for
      compassionate care combined with affordable, advanced medical services.
      Spread across 130 acres, it will have 2,600 beds, 81 specialities, 64
      fully-networked modular operation theatres, and smart ICUs with 534
      critical-care beds that are digitally monitored round-the-clock. The
      hospital fosters Centres of Excellence, which include radiation oncology,
      cardiac sciences, neurosciences, gastro-sciences, bone diseases and
      trauma, transplants, and mother-and-child care. The hospital's
      multidisciplinary children's hospital will be home to maternal and foetal
      medicine and all paediatric subspecialties. This is a feature that many
      private hospitals in India lack as they do not see maternal care as
      financially sustainable. Advanced technology will support this large
      spectrum of practice, including state-of-theart fully-automated smart
      laboratories, the most advanced medical-imaging services in the country,
      and the latest in cardiac and interventional cath labs for clinical
      services. The hospital will also run India's largest facilities for
      infectious diseases.
